//! Per-program **capability grant** — the policy that decides which host functions a
//! program may import (`COMPUTE_EXECUTION_DESIGN.md` §5).
//!
//! Enforcement is at **link time**: the runtime binds *only* the granted imports, so a
//! program importing a capability it wasn't granted **fails to instantiate**
//! (`unknown import`) and cannot escape its grant. The **native default is the
//! [`CapabilityGrant::deterministic`] profile** — the safe (agreeable) floor: a program is
//! consensus-agreeable unless explicitly granted more (fail safe). This is a
//! `MINIMAL_KERNEL` anchor: mechanism binds the surface, the grant is the policy.
//!
//! The full [`Capability`] surface (§4) is declared here up front; Phase 1 only *binds*
//! `Input`/`State`/`Commit`/`Crypto` in the transition runtime — the remaining
//! deterministic caps (`Caller`/`Sql`/`Obj`/`Clock`) and the non-deterministic ones
//! (`WallClock`/`Random`) are declared now and bound in later phases.
