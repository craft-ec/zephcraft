//! Content routing: the `ContentRouting` trait and its Kademlia-DHT backend
//! (`DhtRouting`). Content lookup (providers, wants, metas, and owner-keyed
//! heads) is keyed and served over the DHT; there is no central tracker.
//!
//! Decision R7: routing is a swappable trait so the backend can change without
//! touching callers.
//!
//! Provider records are CANDIDATE LISTS ONLY, never availability truth —
//! HealthScan verifies live (foundation §62.1).
